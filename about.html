          <p>Vish is a 22-year I/T veteran who is now changing lanes and becoming a web developer. After suffering through JavaScript, React and an assortment of libraries, he has moved onto the back-end for this project, furthering his JavaScript torment with Node, Express, SQL and back-end libraries. Fortunately, the back-end has so far proven less painful than Redux.</p>
